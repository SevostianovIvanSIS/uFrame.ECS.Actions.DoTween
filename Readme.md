# DoTween Actions for uFrame ECS

A set of actions to expose DoTween functionality directly to the ECS handlers.

## Targeted Versions

- uFrame ECS (beta2)
- DoTween (1.0.0.67)

## Installation

- Make sure you have added this package with at least the ECSModules folder
- Make sure you have DoTween
- Make sure you have uFrame ECS installed

We have a `dist` folder to allow you to just take the `.unitypackage`, although you can download the source if you wish to make a custom version of the actions.

## Using Actions & Conditions
You should now notice that you have a new category in your actions and conditions called DoTween. You can then put the actions into your project and use them rather than interacting progmatically.
